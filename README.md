# Amine's AI Chatbot with RAG

This project is a fully functional, containerized chatbot application that leverages the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It provides an interactive web interface where users can ask questions and receive intelligent, context-aware answers based on a specific knowledge base about Amine.

The entire application is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a **React/Vite** frontend and a **Python/FastAPI** backend, all orchestrated seamlessly with **Docker Compose**.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The chatbot doesn't just rely on a generic language model. It retrieves relevant information from a custom knowledge base (`rag_text_info.txt`) to provide accurate and context-specific answers about Amine.
-   **Interactive Chat Interface:** A sleek, responsive frontend built with **React**, **Vite**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, featuring a cool "Matrix" style background effect.
-   **Decoupled Architecture:** A separate frontend and backend allows for independent development, scaling, and maintenance.
-   **High-Performance Backend:** The API is built with **FastAPI**, providing a fast, asynchronous server to handle chat requests efficiently.
-   **Fully Containerized:** The entire application stack (frontend, backend) is managed by **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, allowing for a one-command setup and consistent development/production environments.
-   **Customizable Knowledge:** Simply edit the `rag_text_info.txt` file to update or expand the chatbot's knowledge base.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The application follows a simple and powerful client-server model:

1.  The **User** interacts with the **React Frontend**.
2.  The frontend sends the user's query to the **FastAPI Backend** API endpoint.
3.  The backend's RAG logic retrieves the most relevant context from the **Knowledge Base** (`rag_text_info.txt`).
4.  The context and the user's query are sent to a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.
5.  The LLM generates a response, which is sent back through the API to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amineelgardoum-rgb/Rag_amine_chatbot.git
    cd Rag_amine_chatbot
    ```

2.  **Set up Backend Environment Variables (Crucial Step):**
    The backend needs an API key to connect to a Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI).
    -   Navigate to the `chatbot` directory: `cd chatbot`
    -   Create a new file named `.env`: `touch .env`
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your API key. For example:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere"
        ```
    -   **Important:** Remember to return to the root directory before running docker-compose: `cd ..`

3.  **Customize the Knowledge Base (Optional):**
    Open `chatbot/rag_text_info.txt` and add or modify the text content. This is the information the chatbot will use to answer questions about Amine.

### Running the Application

Launch the entire application stack with a single command from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

-   `--build`: Builds the Docker images for the frontend and backend if they don't exist.
-   `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

To check if the services are running correctly:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Accessing the Application

-   **Frontend (Chat Interface):** Open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**
-   **Backend (API Docs):** The API documentation is available at **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)**

## 🛑 Stopping the Services

To stop and remove all the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down```

To also remove the data volumes (if any were configured):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
